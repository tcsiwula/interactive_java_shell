# A interactive Java interperter.

[Interactive Java Shell](https://github.com/tcsiwula/interactive_java_shell) is a Java program for a
processing java code using dynamic class loaders for hotswaping that compiles and runs in real time. My
goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight set of Java files that implement the built in java compiler api specification for use in Java enviroments.
