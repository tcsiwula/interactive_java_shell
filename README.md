# interactive_java_shell
This project teaches you about dynamic compilation, class loaders, and simple lexical analysis (matching nested structures). The project demonstrates that Java can be extremely dynamic. Servers use this technology all the time to reload classes without having to restart the server program. We'll build a read-eval-print loop (REPL) interface for Java code similar to Python's interactive shell.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop
